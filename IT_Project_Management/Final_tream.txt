1.Project management constraints:
we have 3 Time, cost, scope
. Time: Time constraint refers to the project's schedule and the deadline for its completion. 
. Cost: Cost: Cost constraint refers to the project's budget or the financial resources allocated to complete the project.
. Scope:Scope: Scope constraint refers to the work that needs to be accomplished to deliver the project's objectives and meet the stakeholders' requirements

2. Project management skills
. Program area knowledge, standards, and
regulations
. Understand the project environment
. General management skills (budgeting, scheduling)
. Communication skills
. Interpersonal skills
3. exercise 
If Mr. A performs a software programming task alone, it
takes 12 days, and if Mr. B does it alone, it takes six (6)
days. When the two perform the task together, 10% of
everyday’s total work hours is necessary for discussion.
When they perform the task together, how many days are
necessary at least to complete the programming task?
=><<answer>>
+Calculate the work rate of Mr. A:
If Mr. A completes the task alone in 12 days, his work rate would be 1/12 of the task per day.

+Calculate the work rate of Mr. B:
If Mr. B completes the task alone in 6 days, his work rate would be 1/6 of the task per day.

+Determine the combined work rate when they work together:
When working together, we need to consider that 10% of the total work hours are spent on discussion each day. This means 90% of the time is spent on actual work.
The combined work rate when they work together is calculated as follows:
Combined work rate = (Work rate of A + Work rate of B) * 0.9

+Calculate the total work hours required to complete the task when they work together:
Total work hours required = 1 / Combined work rate

Now, let's perform the calculations:

Work rate of Mr. A = 1/12 task per day
Work rate of Mr. B = 1/6 task per day

Combined work rate = (1/12 + 1/6) * 0.9 = (1/12 + 2/12) * 0.9 = (3/12) * 0.9 = 3/40 task per day

Total work hours required = 1 / Combined work rate = 40 / 3 hours

Since there are 8 hours in a workday, the number of days required to complete the task is:
40 / 3 hours ÷ 8 hours per day = 5 days

4.Risk management: IT projects often involve risks related to technology, cybersecurity, compliance, and more. Project management includes identifying, assessing, and managing these risks to minimize their impact on project success.

Q2: IT T Project management is needed because:
IT projects are mostly have time and cost constraints

Q3:They said “The product is intangible”
because:
Software is not touchable

Q4: said
“Manage these or they will manage you!” means:
Be proactive so that we will be on schedule

5. Schedule
The schedule is shared among project members;
• What work (activity/task) needs to be performed,
• Which human resources will perform the work and
• The timeframes in which that work needs to be
performed.

Q1: Which of the following is an appropriate milestone
in a system development project?
=>System acceptance
Q2: The table is a plan at the starting point when a group with six (6)
members develops a system. On the 19th day from the start, 50% of
coding task is completed. Approximately what % of the whole project does the remaining task constitute at the end of the 19th day?
=?57%

Q3: Which of the following is not an appropriate
milestone in a system development project?
=>system error

Q4: Which of the following is inappropriate for
describing a project charter?
=> Project Requirement analysis

Q5: “Project Manager reports the project progress to
customer”, which phase does this activity is in?
=> Design/Development

Q6: In Hierarchical Organization, Human resources is under:
=> Human resources department

Q7: n Functional Organization, Line department includes Sales
department and:
=> Accounting department

Q8:Which organization structure that support multiple
production departments?
=> Divisional system organization

Q9:  Which role is not appropriate for Project Organization?
=> Sales

Q9: Software development life cycle:A framework that describes the activities
performed at each stage of a software
development project.
=> Planning: In this phase, project goals, scope, budget, and timelines are defined. 
=> Requirements Gathering and Analysis: The requirements for the software are collected from stakeholders, and a detailed analysis is performed to understand the needs of the users and the system.
=>Design: The system architecture and design specifications are developed in this phase.
=> Implementation (Coding): The actual coding or programming of the software is done in this phase. Developers write code based on the design specifications.
=> Testing: The software undergoes various levels of testing to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. 
=> Deployment: The software is released and deployed in the production environment after successful testing.
